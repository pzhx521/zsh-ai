# Troubleshooting

Start with the direct command so errors are easy to see:

```bash
zsh-ai "show current date"
```

## API Key Missing

```bash
zsh-ai: Warning: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set. Plugin will not function.
```

Set the key for your provider:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

For permanent setup, put the key above the `zsh-ai` load line in a private `~/.zshrc`.

Or switch to Ollama:

```bash
export ZSH_AI_PROVIDER="ollama"
```

## Ollama Is Not Running

```bash
Error: Ollama is not running at http://localhost:11434
```

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Nothing Happens With `#`

Reload your shell config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then test the explicit command:

```bash
zsh-ai "list files"
```

If that works, restart your terminal so the zle widget binding reloads.

## Pasting Code Breaks `#` Comments

If you paste code blocks that start with `# comment` lines, the inline hook can
intercept the first line and fire an unwanted query. Either change the trigger to
something you won't paste, or disable the hook and use `zsh-ai "..."` instead:

```bash
# Use a different trigger
export ZSH_AI_TRIGGER=",,"

# Or turn the inline hook off entirely
export ZSH_AI_COMMENT_HOOK="false"
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#inline-trigger) for details.

## JSON Parse Errors

Install `jq`:

```bash
brew install jq
```

Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

## Empty Or Truncated Reply

If a request fails with an empty response and the diagnostics show
`finish_reason: length`, the model hit the output token cap. Reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o-series, …) spend part of the budget on hidden chain-of-thought and
may run out before writing the command. Raise the cap:

```bash
export ZSH_AI_MAX_TOKENS="4096"
```

## Inspecting Requests

When logging is enabled (`ZSH_AI_LOG_DIR`), every request is recorded as JSON in
`$ZSH_AI_LOG_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (no API keys). For a full request/response
trace, enable debug logging:

```bash
export ZSH_AI_DEBUG="true"
export ZSH_AI_DEBUG_LOG="$HOME/.zsh-ai-debug.log"   # default
```

## Still Stuck

Check the active provider and model:

```bash
zsh-ai
```

Then open an issue with your OS, zsh version, provider, install method, and exact error:
